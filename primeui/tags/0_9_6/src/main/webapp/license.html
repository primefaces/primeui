                                    appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only
                                    and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices

                                    the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution
                                    notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.
                                    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may
                                    provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,

                                    Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and
                                    distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in
                                    this License.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>5. Submission of Contributions</strong>. Unless You

                            conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the
                            terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor
                            regarding such Contributions.</p>

                        <p><strong>8. Limitation of Liability</strong>. In no event and
                            under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or
                            otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and
                            grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result

                            but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer
                            failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses),
                            even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
                            damages.</p>
                        <p><strong>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability</strong>.
                            While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose

                            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License.
                            However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf
                            and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor,
                            and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor
                            harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such
                            Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
                            liability.</p>
